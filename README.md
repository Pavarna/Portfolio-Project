# ReactJS Portfolio with PrimeReact and TypeScript
This repository showcases a visually appealing and interactive portfolio built using ReactJS and TypeScript. It highlights various components and sections, including Awards, Accomplishments, and a fun, engaging skills section. The project leverages several key libraries and tools such as PrimeReact, PrimeFlex, and CSS to create a responsive, modern UI.

# Features
ReactJS and TypeScript: A combination of ReactJS for UI development and TypeScript for type safety, resulting in a more robust application.
PrimeReact: Utilized for rich UI components like Fieldset, TabView, Splitter, and more to enhance user experience.
PrimeFlex: Integrated for responsive and flexible layouts using the grid system, flexbox, and utility classes.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes with CSS media queries and PrimeFlex classes.
Cool Animations and Effects: Added hover effects, smooth transitions, and visual elements to make the portfolio more engaging.
Bitmoji Integration: A fun, Bitmoji-style avatar GIF adds a personal touch to the portfolio.
Certifications and Awards Section: Displays certificates with zoom functionality and descriptive text panels.
Custom CSS: Tailored styling for each section to maintain a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design.

# Technologies Used
ReactJS: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript, providing type safety.
PrimeReact: Rich set of UI components for React applications.
PrimeFlex: Flexbox-based CSS utility framework for layout design.
HTML5 & CSS3: Standard technologies used for structuring and styling the application.
PrimeIcons: Icon library used within various components like buttons and tabs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
